# Delaunay Triangulation
Given n point in 2D plane and m orthogonal rectangular windows, counts the number of points in each window.

input data:  
* first line  : n  
* next n line : position of point(x,y)  
* next line   : m  
* next m line : top-left and bottom-right corner of window (x1, y1, x2, y2)  

output data:  
* m line: number of point in query window.
