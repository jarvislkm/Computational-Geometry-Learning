# Path finding in simple polygon
Shape of room is a simple polygon(without holes and intersection edges), given two points in the room, find the shortest path.  

input data:  
* first line   :   Start and end point(x1, y1, x2, y2)  
* second line  :  number of points n define polygon shape  
* next n lines : counter clockwise point position. (xi, yi)  

output data:  
* index of points the shortest path go through.  

data generation:

* matlab code for simple polygon point data generation.
