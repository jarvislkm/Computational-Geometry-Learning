# Computational-Geometry-Learning
This repository contains my understanding and code for Computational Geometry Course.<br />

## Problem:
* Convex Hull (Graham's Scan)<br />
* Segment Intersection<br />
* Path Finding in a Simple Polygon<br />
* Voronoi Diagrams (Fortune's method)<br />
* Delaunay Triangulation<br />
* Point Location (Random increasment method)<br />
* Range Tree for Point Window Query (with Fractional Cascading)<br />
* Orthogonal Segment Window Query<br />

## Build:
Build with cmake and make in ./build  
program/data.txt/result.txt all stored in ./build/bin
