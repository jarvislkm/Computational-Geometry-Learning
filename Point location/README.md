# Point location
Given n segments and m points in 2D plane, find the segment vertically above it.    

input data:  
* first line  : n  
* next n line : position of segments(x1,y1,x2,y2)  
* next line   : m  
* next m line : position of points(x, y)  

output data:  
* m lines in total: index of segments, if do not exist, output 'N'
